## What this is

`wow-freesim` (this repo = the **`web`** app) is a browser-based competitor to
Raidbots: it runs **SimulationCraft entirely client-side via WebAssembly**, so
WoW sims execute on the user's own CPU cores instead of a server farm. The site
stays lightweight and cheap/free to host — no sim queue, no per-sim server cost.

This repo is **only the React web UI**. Sibling repo (not here):

- **`simc` fork** — SimulationCraft compiled to threaded WASM via Emscripten.
  **The engine has shipped:** [`simc-wasm`
  `v1205.01`](https://github.com/a-vasilev/simc-wasm/releases/tag/v1205.01)
  publishes `simc.js` (ES6 `createSimc` glue) + `simc.wasm` (~107 MB, threaded/
  SIMD) + `manifest.json` (base SHA + sha256s). The UI still targets the typed
  `SimEngine` seam, but there are now **two real implementations**: `MockEngine`
  (fast iteration/offline) and `WasmEngine` (consumes the release). The real engine
  is brought up **early as a spine** (WEB_UI_PLAN U2), not last. **Caveat:** the
  release is **wasm + glue only** — the **engine-data bundle (`talents.json` /
  `item-index.json`) has NOT shipped yet**, so the talent tree runs on a sample
  fixture / fallback until a later release adds it (WEB_UI_PLAN §3.1, §10).

**There is no separate `data` repo** (the Wowhead decision removed the display-data
pipeline that would have justified one). Item/spell **display** comes from Wowhead at
runtime (no bundle); the **talent-tree + item-search** data is the engine-data bundle
(additive, read-only CI tooling in the fork — *not* source patches, so the fork stays
trivially rebaseable — **pending**, not in `v1205.01`); **Droptimizer loot tables**
are a web-repo CI job added at Phase 3. See OVERALL_PLAN §4/§6.

Full context: [`docs/OVERALL_PLAN.md`](./docs/OVERALL_PLAN.md) (product +
architecture), [`docs/WEB_UI_PLAN.md`](./docs/WEB_UI_PLAN.md) (this app's phased
build plan), and [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](./docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) (the approved
"Editorial Noir" visual design — tokens, typography, components, the WoW item
tooltip spec). Read these before substantial work.

## Stack

React 19 + TypeScript + Vite · Tailwind CSS v4 · Radix UI (headless) · Zustand ·
TanStack Router · Zod · CodeMirror 6 (advanced editor) · visx (charts) · Comlink
(worker) · Dexie (local history) · Fuse.js (item search, later). Hosted on
Cloudflare Pages.

## Non-obvious constraints (these shape everything)

- **Strict theming, zero stray styles.** Two-tier tokens: _primitive_ tokens
  (raw palette/scales, never used in markup) → _semantic_ tokens
  (`color-surface`, `color-accent`, …, the only thing components reference). A
  theme = a remap of semantic→primitive under `[data-theme]`. Tailwind v4
  `@theme` exposes **only semantic tokens** with the default palette stripped, so
  off-token classes (`text-blue-500`, `w-[137px]`) literally don't compile. Never
  hardcode a color/spacing/font value or use inline `style` (tiny allowlist for
  dynamic chart geometry only). The shipped theme is **"noir"** (Editorial Noir);
  values + usage live in [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](./docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) and
  `src/theme/` (the `/styleguide` route renders the live token surface). WoW
  item-quality and tooltip colors are **game constants** — never recolor them.
- **Engine is always behind the `SimEngine` seam.** Nothing in the UI imports
  wasm directly. Build/test against `MockEngine` (worker that returns real-shaped
  `json2` samples).
- **Cross-origin isolation is mandatory** for multithreaded WASM
  (`SharedArrayBuffer` needs `COOP: same-origin` + `COEP: credentialless`). We use
  **`credentialless`, not `require-corp`**, on purpose: it keeps the page isolated
  *and* lets the cross-origin Wowhead tooltip script + icon CDN load (no-cors, no
  CORP headers) — that's what enables rich item/spell tooltips with no data bundle.
  Set via Vite dev headers + Cloudflare `_headers`; runtime guard checks
  `crossOriginIsolated`.
- **Display data comes from Wowhead at runtime, never a bundle.** Item / spell /
  enchant / gem names, icons, and full tooltips are rendered by the Wowhead "Power"
  script (`wow.zamimg.com/js/tooltips.js`) + icon CDN, keyed by the IDs already in
  the simc profile / `json2` (item `bonus=`/`ilvl=`/`gems=`/`ench=` map straight
  from simc item strings). We deliberately **do not build or maintain our own
  item/spell display database — ever.** The only generated data is what the embed
  can't provide: loot-source tables (Droptimizer) + simc-derived talent-tree and
  item-search structures (OVERALL_PLAN §6).
- **Headless components only** (Radix/React Aria) — we own 100% of styling. No
  pre-styled component libraries.
- **GPLv3.** The whole project is open source; no proprietary tier.

## Working notes

- **No tests for now** — deliberate (see WEB_UI_PLAN §7). Don't add a test suite
  unprompted.
- **Design has landed: "Editorial Noir".** The token system, typography, layout
  shell, and component specs are settled in
  [`docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](./docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) + `src/theme/`; reference
  screens are in `docs/mockups/` (`gear.html`, `report.html`). Build new UI
  against these tokens, not ad-hoc styles. Fonts are **self-hosted** via
  `@fontsource-variable/*` (CDN webfonts are blocked under COEP — see
  `src/main.tsx`).
- Platform is Windows; shell is PowerShell (Bash tool also available).
- Otherwise standard Vite/React conventions — no need to document routine
  commands here.
